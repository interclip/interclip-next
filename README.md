# Interclip Next

> **Note**: This repository is currently **not** worked on. Its main contributor, @filiptronicek (hi btw :wave:) wants to focus his time on maintaining and developing https://github.com/interclip/interclip, because the Next.js-rewrite, although making DX so much better just can't match the UX of v3 (think speed, reliability with serverless functions and db calls).

Something new is cookin' for the NextÂ® generation of sharing.
